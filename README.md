# nations of planet earth

this is what i have done with the free Rest Countries API
it was fun..
 thanks to the guys from Rest Countries!

About my little app:

you can select nations over the name search, you can search regions of nations,
and you can see the nations details when you click on them for showing some detail 
information about the selected nation.
On the Detail Page you can rezise the coat of arms, and go to goole maps to see the nation there..

done with NEXT.js and React

here the API Link. https://restcountries.com/

~ there are some issues when you fetch data from RestCountries, 
like wrong car signs. e.g. for 
germany they provide the army car signs not the default national car sign.
